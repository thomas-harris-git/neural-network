# Coding a Neural Network (University Project)
Project: Creating a Neural Network (Individual Project)

Technology: Pioneer Mobile Robot, Visual Studio, C++, Windows

Duration: 2 Â½ Months

Description: This project involved having to design and develop a Neural Network in C++ without the use of any libraries. Data was gathered from a robot that performed the task that was desired, which was following the wall of a small cube. I implemented all the various calculation required for the forward and back propagation as well as data shuffling and building and tuning the network.
